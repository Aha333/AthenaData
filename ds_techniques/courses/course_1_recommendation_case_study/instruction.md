# askded gpt
i have 3 data called log_parta.txt, log_partb.txt, log_partc.txt. Seems to be a data saved in three parts. The data has four columns item_id, user_id, action, vtime.

Each txt file is around 20 GB size.

Now, I am using macbook pro m2, how to build a data base for me to read and query the data in for example a notebook. 
Tell me how to set up and use it step by step
